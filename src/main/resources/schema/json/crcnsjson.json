We recorded cells in L2/3 of the primary visual cortex in anesthetized mice watching drifting grating movie. A small field of view was imaged to acquire the highest possible SNR. We include for each cell the raw fluorescence signal from the cell soma, neuropil signal from the cell surroundings, raw electrophysiological recording data, high-pass filtered electrophysiological recording data and spikes. The contrast of the visual stimulus and the drifting grating orientation were modified during each recording to produce variety of spike rates, and is not included in the data set.

These recordings were performed to assess the effect of novel spatial learning on hippocampal CA1 neural firing and LFP patterns in na\u00efve animals. Each session consisted of a long (~4 hour) PRE rest/sleep epoch home-cage recordings performed in a familiar room, followed by a Novel MAZE running epoch (~45 minutes) in which the animals were transferred to a novel room, and water-rewarded to run on a novel maze. These mazes were either A) a wooden 1.6m linear platform, B) a wooden 1m diameter circular platform or C) a 2m metal linear platform. Animals were rewarded either at both ends of the linear platform, or at a predetermined location on the circular platform. The animal was gently encouraged to run unidirectionally on the circular platform. After the MAZE epochs the animals were transferred back to their home-cage in the familiar room where a long (~4 hour) POST rest/sleep was recorded. All eight sessions were concatenated from the PRE, MAZE, and POST recording epochs. In addition to hippocampal electrophysiological recordings, neck EMG and head-mounted accelerometer signals were recorded, and the animal\u2019s position during MAZE running epochs was tracked via head-mounted LEDs.",

We measured the parameters of transmission from pairs of  CA3 area PV positive basket and axo-axonic, as well as CCK positive basket and dendrite targeting neurons in mouse (postnatal 19-25 days) in vitro hippocampal slices.  Presynaptic cells were stimulated by a train of 10 action potentials at frequencies physiological in the hippocampus (1 Hz, 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz, 40 Hz, 80 Hz, 160 Hz, 320 Hz). We also tested the response of connections to inputs reflecting the behavior of perisomatic-region targeting interneurons during sharp wave-ripples (RIP protocol - 4 APs at 160 Hz) and pathological interictal events (EPI protocol - 30 APs at 160 Hz followed by 4 APs at 320 Hz). The time constant of recovery from inhibition was calculated using stimuli, which consisted of two consecutive RIP protocols where the time between the two RIP patterns was systematically varied. The intervals used were 50 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms, 300 ms, 500 ms, 800 ms, and 1200 ms. We present the raw experimental data as well as data tables characterizing (amplitude, success rate, etc.) the transmission for all recorded cell pairs. A summary table helps orientation.",

For each recording session, single-cell recordings (N=343; 219 from monkey X and 124 from monkey B) were made in the superficial cortex of the SPL (area 5), as judged by recording depth and similarity to previous recordings made in this area with standard neurophysiological techniques. Activity was recorded extracellularly with varnish-coated tungsten microelectrodes (~1- to 2-M\u03a9 impedance at 1 kHz). Single action potentials (spikes) were isolated from the amplified and filtered (600\u20136,000 Hz) signal via a time-amplitude window discriminator (Plexon). Spike times were sampled at 2.5 kHz. Within a virtual reality environment where visual feedback of the limb could be manipulated, animals performed a reaction-time task involving combined eye and arm movements from a single (central) starting position to one of eight peripheral targets.  Results from the experiments are described in: Shi, Y., G. Apker, and C.A. Buneo, Multimodal representation of limb endpoint position in the posterior parietal cortex.

        "description": "The data set was collected from extracellular spike recordings in whisker primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of rats performing a whisker based discrimination task. Neural activity is described by the spike times of isolated single and multiunit clusters obtained from spike sorting from moveable tetrode arrays. The whisker stimuli consisted of rapid whisker impulse sequences.  Each sequence (120-150 ms total duration) contained 3 brief impulses (16-26 ms each) with either Fast (F), Medium (M) or Slow (S) rise-fall velocity.  Sequences had FFF, FMS, SMF or SSS order.  Thus, sequences varied in whisker deflection speed at short (5-20 ms) and long (150 ms) time scales.  On each trial, one stimulus was delivered, and rats discriminated stimuli in a 2-alternative forced choice task.  Hence, this data set serves as a resource to explore the time scales at which cortical neurons encode whisker stimuli and how their spiking activity correlates to sensory perception. The structure contains trial information and complete neurophysiology data from 5 rats, over a total of 80 recording sessions.  Neural recordings are from layer 2/3 to 6 of S1, and include both fast-spiking and regular spiking single units (identified separately).  These data are the basis for the following paper, which contains a detailed description of the methods and results:  Short time-scale sensory coding in S1 during discrimination of whisker vibrotactile sequences.

The aim was to investigate how neurons with sensitivity to different dynamic features of whisker stimuli are distributed locally across the barrel cortex. We found that nearby neurons represent diverse kinematic features, providing a rich population representation at the local scale. The results are compatible with randomly distributed selectivity to stimulus features, with no systematic additional map or ordering scheme superimposed upon the whisker map. Our data can be usefully contrasted to similar results in mouse visual and auditory cortex, and to data collected by other groups in the barrel cortex.

Spikes were recorded in VPM, L4 excitatory neurons, and L4 fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Importantly, L4 recordings were made with loos-seal pipettes to avoid sampling bias.

They have been used to calibrate and validate our tES models which may be published in the manuscripts referenced in the data set description.  We hope these data can also be used in the future to facilitate the validation of newly developed modeling approaches for the study of tES. Also the magnetic resonance image (MRI) of each subject is included.  Note that the raw ECoG recordings are not included in this data set. The voltage values in this data set are estimated by fitting a sinusoid to the recordings at each intracranial electrode. They are therefore the electrical potentials in the brain induced by the stimulation, not the spontaneous brain activities.",
