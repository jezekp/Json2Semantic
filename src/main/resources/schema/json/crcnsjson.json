Thalamic and subicular electrodes yielding high number of the so-called Head-Direction (HD) cells were likely to be located in the AD nucleus and the PoS, respectively. Electrode placement was confirmed by histology. The data was obtained during 42 recording sessions and includes responses of 720 neurons in the thalamus and 357 neurons in the PoS, in seven animals while they foraged for food in an open environment (53- x 46-cm).",

There are three sets of data: a voltage clamp control dataset (VC, n=17), a current clamp control dataset (ICS, n=21) and a bicuculline voltage clamp dataset (VCB, n=38). Complete recordings contain a baseline of at least 10 minutes, followed by a pairing protocol in which extracellular stimulation was paired with an intracellularly-evoked (in current clamp) burst of spikes and a post-pairing epoch of at least 10 minutes.

        "desc": "The data set was collected from extracellular spike recordings in whisker primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of rats performing a whisker based discrimination task. Neural activity is described by the spike times of isolated single and multiunit clusters obtained from spike sorting from moveable tetrode arrays. The whisker stimuli consisted of rapid whisker impulse sequences. Each sequence (120-150 ms total duration) contained 3 brief impulses (16-26 ms each) with either Fast (F), Medium (M) or Slow (S) rise-fall velocity. Sequences had FFF, FMS, SMF or SSS order. Thus, sequences varied in whisker deflection speed at short (5-20 ms) and long (150 ms) time scales. On each trial, one stimulus was delivered, and rats discriminated stimuli in a 2-alternative forced choice task. Hence, this data set serves as a resource to explore the time scales at which cortical neurons encode whisker stimuli and how their spiking activity correlates to sensory perception. The structure contains trial information and complete neurophysiology data from 5 rats, over a total of 80 recording sessions. Neural recordings are from layer 2/3 to 6 of S1, and include both fast-spiking and regular spiking single units (identified separately). These data are the basis for the following paper, which contains a detailed description of the methods and results: Short time-scale sensory coding in S1 during discrimination of whisker vibrotactile sequences.

They have been used to calibrate and validate our tES models which may be published in the manuscripts referenced in the data set description. We hope these data can also be used in the future to facilitate the validation of newly developed modeling approaches for the study of tES. Also the magnetic resonance image (MRI) of each subject is included. Note that the raw ECoG recordings are not included in this data set. The voltage values in this data set are estimated by fitting a sinusoid to the recordings at each intracranial electrode. They are therefore the electrical potentials in the brain induced by the stimulation, not the spontaneous brain activities.",

We measured the parameters of transmission from pairs of CA3 area PV positive basket and axo-axonic, as well as CCK positive basket and dendrite targeting neurons in mouse (postnatal 19-25 days) in vitro hippocampal slices. Presynaptic cells were stimulated by a train of 10 action potentials at frequencies physiological in the hippocampus (1 Hz, 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz, 40 Hz, 80 Hz, 160 Hz, 320 Hz). We also tested the response of connections to inputs reflecting the behavior of perisomatic-region targeting interneurons during sharp wave-ripples (RIP protocol - 4 APs at 160 Hz) and pathological interictal events (EPI protocol - 30 APs at 160 Hz followed by 4 APs at 320 Hz). The time constant of recovery from inhibition was calculated using stimuli, which consisted of two consecutive RIP protocols where the time between the two RIP patterns was systematically varied. The intervals used were 50 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms, 300 ms, 500 ms, 800 ms, and 1200 ms. We present the raw experimental data as well as data tables characterizing (amplitude, success rate, etc.) the transmission for all recorded cell pairs. A summary table helps orientation.",

The recordings were performed with a large multielectrode array (Multichannel Systems, square lattice, 60 electrodes, 200 μm interelectrode spacing, 30 μm electrode diameter, flat electrodes). The cultures were not stimulated, so these data represent spontaneous activity. In total, 435 recordings are provided, most of which possess about one hundred neurons (min: 3, max: 142, mean: 91, total: 39,529). The average firing rate of the neurons was 1.9 Hz. The data were binned at 20 kHz and are presented in units of bins (0.05 ms). The lengths of the recordings were approximately 1 hour.",
